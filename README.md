## Overview

Everything you need is contained within the `/templates/` folder. This includes all the files needed to start a project from scratch, which include:

- `.github/` folder with templates for working with Github's `Issue` and `Pull Request`. See [the screenshots below][screenshots] for how these integrate with Github.
- `.gitignore` file to ignore certain files and folders.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file which governs your project.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` file outlining how contributors can get involved.
- `README.md` file which is very basic and can be tailored to your needs.
- `_licenses/` folder containing all available open-source licenses.

This is the full file breakdown of the `/templates/` folder.
