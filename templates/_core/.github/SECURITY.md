## GitHub Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet
companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. GitHub's bounty program gives a tip of
the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for
critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here][hackerone].

You can find useful information in GitHub's [rules][gh-rules],
[scope][gh-scope], [targets][gh-target] and [FAQ][gh-faq].
